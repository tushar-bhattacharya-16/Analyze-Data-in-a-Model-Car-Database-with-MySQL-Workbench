# Analyze-Data-in-a-Model-Car-Database-with-MySQL-Workbench
My analysis process for the Coursera project "Analyze Data in a Model Car Database with MySQL Workbench".

In this project, I will assist in the analysis of data in a relational database as an entry-level data analyst at the Mint Classics Company in order to support business choices regarding inventory that result in the closure of a storage facility.

Working on this project allowed me to show off my proficiency with SQL and its application to efficient inventory management. My aim was to demonstrate how to evaluate warehouse data, comprehend the distribution of product inventories, and offer useful recommendations for enhancing inventory control.

Through this project, I wanted to demonstrate my ability for data-driven decision-making, which will increase the strategic and operational effectiveness of inventory management.
